<h1>DrQ.sol — Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: February 1, 2026</em></p>

<div class="summary"><strong>Quick summary:</strong> We only access GitHub data that you authorize when installing the DrQ.sol GitHub App. We use that data to provide and secure the Service. You can stop future access at any time by uninstalling the app.</div>

<h2>1. Who we are</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>drqsatoshin</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses and shares information when you use the DrQ.sol GitHub App and related services (the “Service”). You can contact us at <a href="mailto:josef.edwards@drqsatoshin.com">josef.edwards@drqsatoshin.com</a>.</p>

<h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
<h3>2.1 Information from GitHub (when you install or use the app)</h3>
<p>Information we receive depends on the permissions you grant and the repositories or organizations where the app is installed. Depending on the configuration, we may receive:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Installation and account identifiers:</strong> GitHub installation ID, repository IDs, organization or user IDs, repository names and user or organization login names.</li>
<li><strong>Repository metadata:</strong> Default branch, visibility, collaborators (as permitted), and basic repository settings.</li>
<li><strong>Event and webhook payload data:</strong> Data included in GitHub webhook events that the app is subscribed to (e.g., issue or pull request metadata, comments and commit metadata).</li>
<li><strong>Content:</strong> Repository contents, files or diffs if the app has permissions that allow access to content.</li>
<li><strong>Operational signals:</strong> Technical metadata such as delivery IDs and timestamps provided by GitHub APIs and webhooks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2 Information you provide directly</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support communications:</strong> Messages you send us by email or other channels.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration:</strong> Settings you choose for the app (rules, toggles, repository selections, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.3 Website and service technical data</h3>
<p>If you visit our website or interact with our service endpoints, we (or our hosting providers) may collect standard log data such as IP address, user agent, request timestamps and referring URLs for security and reliability.</p>

<h2>3. How we use information</h2>
<ul>
<li>To provide, operate and maintain the Service.</li>
<li>To perform the actions you request in the repositories where the app is installed.</li>
<li>To secure the Service, including abuse prevention, incident detection, rate limiting and debugging.</li>
<li>To provide support and respond to inquiries.</li>
<li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. How we share information</h2>
<p>We may share information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>With service providers (subprocessors):</strong> Third‑party hosting, databases, logging or monitoring providers, but only as needed to run the Service.</li>
<li><strong>For legal reasons:</strong> To comply with law, respond to lawful requests or protect rights and safety.</li>
<li><strong>With your consent or at your direction.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In business transfers:</strong> If we undergo a merger, acquisition or asset sale, information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong></p>

<h2>5. Data retention</h2>
<p>We retain information only as long as reasonably necessary to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce agreements. If you uninstall the app, we will delete or de‑identify stored data associated with the installation within a reasonable period, except where we must retain it for legal or security reasons.</p>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect information, such as access controls and encryption where appropriate. However, no system is completely secure.</p>

<h2>7. Your choices and rights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uninstall the app:</strong> You can uninstall the DrQ.sol GitHub App at any time to stop future access.</li>
<li><strong>Repository scope:</strong> You can limit which repositories the app can access by adjusting the installation settings.</li>
<li><strong>Contact us for requests:</strong> To request access to, or deletion of, information we maintain about you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:josef.edwards@drqsatoshin.com">josef.edwards@drqsatoshin.com</a>. We may need to verify your identity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. International data transfers</h2>
<p>If you access the Service from outside the country where our servers or providers are located, your information may be transferred and processed internationally. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for cross‑border transfers.</p>

<h2>9. Children’s privacy</h2>
<p>The Service is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

<h2>10. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version and revise the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.</p>
